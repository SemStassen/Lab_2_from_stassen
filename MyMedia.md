# Sem Stassen
I'm Sem, 20 years old and studying at NW Missouri as an exchange student for the semester. 
My favourite song at the moment, because it changes quite often, is "A divebar named Nirvana" by Dogpark.
An up and coming band from Chicago, currently touring all over the US.

| But how do it know? | This books provides a simple yet thorough look at the inner workings of a computer. Showcasing how something extremely complex can be build from very simple and understandable parts. | J. Clark Scott |
| Climate Denial: A measured response | HBomberGuy provides fascinating, humorous and intelligent insights intate the brains of climate deniars. He sticks to the facts and tries to relate to both sides of the argument. | HBomberGuy |
| Creative coding for Beginners | This video holds a special place in my heart because it was my first real introduction to (creative) programming. Shiffman teaches coding in a clear, interactive and funny way, keeping my interest high all the way to the end. | TheCodingTrain |
| Sapiens | As a long time history nerd, Harari provides a short (for history) but complete view of most of human history. There is some needed context missing here and there, but for anyone wanting to understand more about how we got where we are today, this is a great read! | yuvah Noah Harari |
